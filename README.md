# TensorFlow_Object_Detection (On going)

## Abstract: Machine Learning for Wildlife Conservation

This project will investigate and discuss the various implementation of machine learning techniques in object detection for identifying wildlife from captured images. The aim of this project is to detect animal species through Raspberry Pi camera. 

It is implemented by machine learning technology by training and testing the model from very huge dataset of camera trapped images and deploying this model on Raspberry Pi.

Key task of project is 'object detection' which is specifically aims to detect a species of particular animal by fine tuning the hyperparameters and creating bounding boxes spanning the interest region in image. 

This will undoubtably help for resource management for wildlife conservation and will be also helpful for future research, studies by conservationists.
